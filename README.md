Express middleware to speed up systemjs development loads by running translations serverside.

This middleware will intercept requests for JavaScript modules, identified by an `application/x-es-module` accept-header that SystemJS always provides.
When intercepting a module request the middleware will bundle the module with all its dependencies on the fly, using any available version of jspm or systemjs-builder in your project. Translating and bundling reduces the time spent in the browser on incremental discovery of modules, amout of roundtrips, heavy uncacheable translation operations and so forth.

Initial loads are running at the speed of a serverside bundling operation. Incremental rebuilds when one or more files have changed correctly leverage the SystemJS builders cache, making incremental changes even faster to load

Projects with 1000+ modules, taking ~60 seconds for a full load with browser-only loading and translation, are known to reduce to 4 seconds build time on initial load and 2 second build time on incremental rebuilds and loads.


Usage
-----

You can use express-systemjs-translate with either [jspm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspm) or [systemjs-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systemjs-builder). The configuration with jspm is simpler, since `baseUrl` the path to your systemjs configuration are implicit.

This middleware will only handle requests to javascript modules, so it is recommended to have different middleware handling static file requests further down the middleware stack. [express.static](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) serves this purpose very well.

**Example usage with JSPM:**

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var translate = require('express-systemjs-translate');

var app = express()
  .use(translate())
  .use(express.static('path/to/webroot'));

app.listen(3000);
```

**Example usage with systemjs-builder:**

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var translate = require('express-systemjs-translate');

var app = express()
  .use(translate({
    baseUrl: 'path/to/webroot',
    configFile: 'relative/path/from/baseUrl/to/config.js'
  }))
  .use(express.static('path/to/webroot'));

app.listen(3000);
```

SystemJS Configuration
----------------------

In order to make the middleware work correctly a few SystemJS configurations are essential.

You need the `[defaultjsextensions](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/config-api.md#defaultjsextensions)` setting to be `false`. This is default from SystemJS 0.17 and above. If this setting is missing you are likely to encounter issues with wrong file name resolving.

You need to configure loader plugin patterns matches in your configuration rather than using the plugin syntax inline (eg. `System.import('path/to/template.tpl!tpl'))`). Instead you need to configure your `meta` section to apply your desired loader on the specific module patterns you need.

An SystemJS configuration following these rules could look like this:

```js
System.config({
  defaultJsExtensions: false, // Only needed in SystemJS 0.16 and below

  meta: {
    '/**/*.tpl': { loader: 'tpl' },
    '/**/*.css': { loader: 'css' }
  }
});
```

Midleware Configuration
-----------------------

The translate middelware takes a few options to adapt to your project setup. This is the full configuration API:

```js
var translate = require('express-systemjs-translate');

var middleware = translate({
  // Server root. Defaults to current working directory, as most usages will be through `npm start`
  // This setting is not in active use at the moment
  serverRoot: process.cwd(),

  // SystemJS baseURL.
  // Only needed if you are using systemjs-builder directly
  // If you use jspm the configuration will be automatic
  // Defaults to `process.cwd()` if not provided
  baseUrl: process.cwd(),

  // Path to SystemJS config file. Path should be relative to SystemJS baseURL.
  // Only needed if you are using systemjs-builder directly
  // If you use jspm the configuration will be automatic
  // Defaults to `system.config.js` if not provided
  configFile: 'system.config.js',

  // Bundle module dependencies.
  // Dependencies will be translated and prepended to the response
  // Bundling is significantly faster than only compiling the individual module
  // Defaults to `true`
  bundle: true,

  // Watch served files for changes
  // This will speed up incremental rebuilds by only doing work on files known to have changed
  // Defaults to `true`
  watchFiles: true,

  // Enable logging for debugging purposes
  debug: false,

  // Build flags that will be passed on to systemjs-builder.
  // These are only needed if any of your plugins require options
  buildFlags: {}
});
```
