<h1>Possible sourcemap problem</h1>

<p>This page loads two primary modules <a href="lib/external.js">lib/external.js</a> and <a href="lib/inlined.js">lib/inlined.js</a></p>

<p>external.js points at an internal source map <a href="lib/external.js.map">lib/external.js.map</a></p>
<p>inlined.js has it's source map <a href="lib/inlined.js.map">lib/inlined.js.map</a> inlined as a base64 data-url</p>

<p>Both files source maps define a file, either external.js or inlined.js, which has different content that the served file. This is the original file content. A middleware has intercepted the request and done an on the fly bundling.</p>

<p>I expect the source maps to help the browser make the original content available in the developer tools sources tab under the served file name.</p>

<p>In the case of an external source map a new entry appears in the sources tab called "external.js [sm]" alongside exernal.js. The [sm]-file contains the source maps delivered source, while the non-[sm]-file contains the content as delivered on the wire</p>

<p>In the case of the inlined source map no similar [sw]-file appears in the sources tab. And inlined.js shows the source as delivered on the wire</p>

<p>This page itself recreates the issue, to you can inspect the source tab yourself.</p>

<hr>

<p>I expected to see the original source of inlined.js from the source maps delivered source to be available in the devloper tools sources tab.</p>

<p>Is this a bug in Chrome?</p>

<p>I'm running Chrome 51.0.2704.106 (64-bit) on OSX</p>
